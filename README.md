# Date & Time Snippets

[â¤“ Download Workflow]()

## About

Adds a list of custom snippets with current date, time, relative dates, and more to Alfred.

## How it works

## Unix date command

- Start reading from the purple object executing the `date` command.
- `date` is provided with two arguments: `format` and `params`.
- Before the command is run, a `locale` is set to the environment.
- `format` specifies the output format. For exampel the order between day and month.
- `params` specifies what date to use. If it's not blank, todays date will be used.

### Workflow object colours

- Yellow "Snippets" defines a snippet in the "Primary locale".
- Yellow "Arg and Vars" sets variable `format` aligned to "Primary locale".
- Blue "Snippets" defines a snippet in the "Secondary locale".
- Blue "Arg and Vars" sets variable `format` aligned to "Secondary locale".
- Gray "Arg and Vars" sets variable `params` to define a date (used by all locales).
- Purple "Arg and Vars" sets variable `format` to a format used by all locales.
- Red objects are used to execute the command and output the result.
