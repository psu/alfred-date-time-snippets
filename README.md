# Date & Time Snippets

## About

Custom snippets with current time, relative dates and more

## How it works

## Unix date command

- Start reading from the purple object executing the `date` command.
- `date` is provided with a format argument and a params argument.
- Before the command is run, a locale is set to the environment

### Workflow object colours

- Yellow "Snippet" is in the "Primary locale"
- Yellow "Arg and Vars" adds a format in "Primary locale"
- Blue "Snippet" is in the "Secondary locale"
- Blue "Arg and Vars" adds a format in "Secondary locale" (default en_US)

### asdf

- The mindset is "localized", english is the sencond locale
